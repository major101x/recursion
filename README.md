# Recursion
This is a recursion project from The Odin Project where I was told to write two functions: 

- Fibs: A function that takes a number of terms value and prints all fibonacci numbers up to that value.

- Sort: A function that uses recursive merge sort to sort an array in ascending order.

## Lessons learned
I learned about iterative and recursive functions, how to loop through arrays in a recursive function. I also learned how to use single arguments to perform complex operations on recursive functions.
